# aries-react-challenge


## Objective

Design and implement a front-end for options strategy risk and reward analysis using React.

## Brief

Your challenge is to create a React component that can generate a risk & reward graph for options strategies. The component should accept an input of up to four options contracts and output the following:
1. A risk & reward graph where X is the price of the underlying at the time of expiry and Y is the profit/loss at that price. 
2. Max profit, max loss, and all break even points.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness of the logic
- Usability of the graph
- Aesthetics of the UI
- Readability and code structure

### CodeSubmit 

Organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the main branch.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Usage

Run `npm install` to install node_modules

Run `npm run dev` to see the project locally on http://127.0.0.1:5173/

Run `npm test` to view passing tests
